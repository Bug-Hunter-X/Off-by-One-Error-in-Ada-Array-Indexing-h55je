This example demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Ada programming when dealing with array indexing.  Ada arrays are 1-based, unlike 0-based arrays in languages like C or Python. The bug occurs when the loop index is used directly without considering the 1-based indexing, potentially causing an exception or incorrect behavior.  The solution illustrates the correct way to access array elements in Ada.
